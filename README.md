This repository contains guides, scripts and templates to help learners run local vulnerability scans using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials. **Use these materials only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.**


## Contents

- `templates/` — Report and remediation templates to document findings.


## Quick start


1. Read `HINTS.md` and `scan-guide.md`.
2. Install OpenVAS (GVM) or Nessus Essentials on your machine or use a VM.
3. Configure a scan target (localhost or your machine IP).
4. Run a scan and save the results as a report.
5. Use `templates/report_template.md` to document vulnerabilities and recommended fixes.
